	<div class="intro">
		<h2>Hello 👋</h2>
		<p>
			I'm Avinash, someone who finds joy in the simple things: clean
			interfaces, readable code, and that perfect moment when everything
			just clicks into place.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3>A bit about me</h3>
	<p>
		Big fan of technology and free open source software
		<small>(free as in freedom, not price)</small>. I'm still figuring
		myself out, evolving big time, and honestly enjoying the journey.
	</p>
	<p>
		I built this website as my little corner of the internet - a place to
		share thoughts, document learnings, and maybe connect with like-minded
		folks who appreciate the craft of building things that matter.
	</p>

	<h3>What I'm up to lately</h3>
	<p>
		Shipping small, focused projects to sharpen the craft. Exploring
		patterns that make things scale without the overhead. Always learning
		something new.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Next on my list:</b>
		exploring the Bun + Hono + Cloudflare stack and Rust (because systems thinking
		helps everywhere).
	</p>

	<h3>Random bits about me</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Prefer chai over coffee ☕️ (and honestly, green tea is overrated)
		</li>
		<li>Team Android, always</li>
		<li>Favorite colors: black, white, blue, and gray</li>
		<li>
			Can type at
			<a target="_blank" href="https://monkeytype.com/profile/Avi-Lvs"
				>70wpm on average</a
			>
			<small>(best: 83wpm - not impressive, I know)</small>
		</li>
		<li>Believer in "good enough" over perfect</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Other non-interesting stuff</h3>
	<p>
		You'll find my <a href="/notes">public notes</a> here - thoughts, learnings,
		and random discoveries I've documented along the way. Also check out the
		<a href="/books">books I've read</a> and my thoughts on them.
