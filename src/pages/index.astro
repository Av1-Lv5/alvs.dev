		<p>
			Welcome to my little corner of the Internet. Here I share my work,
			thoughts, other places you can find me at.
		</p>

		<h3>I Create</h3>
		<p>
			Webpages and Webapps. The main area of my focus is in front-end
			development. Check out
			<a href="/projects/">projects</a>
			 I've built so far. I also tend to create Happiness around me.
		</p>

		<h3>Languages and Tools</h3>
		<Skills />
		<blockquote>
			For a detailed and exhaustive list of skills and tools, read <a
				href="/notes/skills-and-tools"
			>
				my public note on skills and tools.

		<h3>About this site</h3>
		<p>
			This site uses
			<a href="https://simplecss.org/" target="_blank">simplecss</a>
			 as base styling, re-built with
			<a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a>, and hosted
			on
			<a href="https://netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. You can
			checkout the source
			<a
				href={`https://github.com/${socials.githubUsername}/alvs.dev`}
				target="_blank">@github</a
			>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can read more about the build process, and plans for this site
			<a href="./projects/alvs/">here</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Every section of this site has long changelogs. I am completely
			unsure of what goes in.
