    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Refining the craft via OrbitBudget:</strong> Spending under 3 hours
        daily on focused tasks to sharpen my time estimation skills while shipping
        clean, scalable patterns without adding unnecessary overhead. Following a
        strict rule that no AI pair-programming, I'll use it as a chatbox at most,
        not as a co-pilot.
      </li>
      <li>Working on this website.</li>
      <li>I started reading Kautilya's Arthashastra</li>
      <li>
        <strong>The search for the next big project:</strong> Interviewing with teams
        to find a project that reignites the spark I felt at 1acre.in, while keeping
        freelance work going to sustain the journey.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Feeding the movie buff:</strong> striking off one movie a week from
        my watchlist.
      </li>
    </ul>
