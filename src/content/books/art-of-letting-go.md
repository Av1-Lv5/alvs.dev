thoughts: 'Perfect timing for this one - my brain was stuck in overthinking mode and this book basically told me to chill. Not your typical "just breathe" advice though. Actually practical stuff about what you can control (hint: less than you think) and what you can''t (spoiler: most things). Now I spend less time spiraling over things that are out of my hands. Revolutionary, I know.'
