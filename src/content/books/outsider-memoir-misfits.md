thoughts: "Finally, a book that gets it. Vir writes about being the weird kid everywhere - India, Africa, America - and somehow makes it hilarious instead of sad. Reading this felt like someone saying all the things I think but never say out loud. Plus, it's proof that being a misfit isn't a character flaw, it's just... character. Who knew washing dishes in Chicago could lead to Netflix specials?"
