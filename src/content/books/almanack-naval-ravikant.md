thoughts: "Naval's tweets compiled into a book - and somehow it works? Feels like chatting with that wise friend who's rich AND happy (rare combo). His \"happiness is when nothing is missing\" hit different - made me stop chasing the next shiny thing for five minutes. Also convinced me wealth isn't just luck, which is either motivating or terrifying depending on how you look at it."
