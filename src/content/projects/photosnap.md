### About

Photosnap is a multi-page marketing site for a photo-sharing platform built with [Astro](https://astro.build) most styling is done using [Astro scoped styles](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#scoped-styles).

### Learnings

-   Implementing the responsive design to the pricing, and features table took a bit of time to plan.
-   Got a bit more familiarised with [Astro](https://astro.build)
