### Technical sheet code

-   This app is built in plain HTML, CSS and JS.
-   Though the app seems like a Single Page Application, it isn't using any spa frameworks/libraries. The implementation is just switching between '.show' & '.hide' css classes for blocks of html.

### Random facts

-   Building this project made me realise the need to learn a javascript framework.
-   It took me a week to complete this project.
-   Learnt refactoring codebase, as my first implementation was a mess, a clear example of ugly code.
-   Realised building a game is more fun than building landing pages.
