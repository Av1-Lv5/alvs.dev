### Features Implemented

-   Local multi-player mode

### Technical sheet code

-   This app is built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, no frameworks and no external dependencies.
-   Though the app seems like a Single Page Application, it isn't using any spa frameworks/libraries. The implementation is just switching between '.show' & '.hide' css classes for blocks of html.

### Learnings

-   Building this project made me realise the need to learn a javascript framework.
-   Learnt refactoring codebase, as my first implementation was a mess, a clear example of ugly code.
-   Realised building a game is more fun than building landing pages.

### Plans

-   Implement online multi-player mode
-   Implement computer mode
