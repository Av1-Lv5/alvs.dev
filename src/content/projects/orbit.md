### Overview

Orbit is a daily budget tracker designed to help you master your money day by day. Instead of complex categories and bank connections, it calculates a daily safe-to-spend limit based on your budget and expenses. It follows a "Philosophy of Less" no charts to analyze, no guilt to feel, just a clear daily rhythm to keep your finances in flow.

### Key Features

-   **Daily Safe-to-Spend Limit**: Automatically calculates what you can spend today based on your budget and remaining days. If you save today, you have more for tomorrow.
-   **Zero Setup**: No bank connections to break, no complex categories to configure. Just set a budget and start tracking.
-   **Quick Entry**: A focused interface designed to let you log expenses in seconds, reducing friction and encouraging consistency.
-   **Strictly Private**: No ads, no selling data.

### Technical Architecture

-   **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript.
-   **Backend**: Supabase.

### Future Roadmap

- Building Android and iOS apps
- Export data into CSV or PDF
- Add your partner to a budget
