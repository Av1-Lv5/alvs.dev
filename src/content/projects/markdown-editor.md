### Key Features

- Create, Read, Delete and Update notes.
- Mobile responsive
- Notes are stored on Local storage.
- Preview mode
- Light and Dark mode

### Technical Architecture

- Build using **React**, **Typescript** and **Vite**.
- Used [markdown-it node package &#x2197;](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it) to parse markdown syntax to HTML.

### Learnings

- Faced the issue of prop drilling, later implemented state management using [native context api &#x2197;](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/avoid-prop-drilling-with-react-context-api/).

### Future Roadmap

- Able to select a different font.
- Support for Syntax highlighting using [shiki &#x2197;](https://shiki.style/)

### Attributions
