### Design decisions

The reason to use [simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) a classless CSS library is, it forces me to use semantic HTML, also less to worry about the design.

Sometimes it does confuse me, do I even like minimal design or am I just too lazy to create my own design. May be its both and it mostly worked out well for this site.

### Plans

-   Like to have a blog, to write about my learnings, personal endeavours, critical decisions, software comparisions, and my niche in web development, including workflows and setups..

### Archives

1. My first draft was just plain html and css, I hardcoded the entire site in a single page, but later decided to convert it into multi-page site.
2. **[2022 jan - 2022 dec]** Used pug templating and gulp task runner for the ease of maintaining the source. You can check out source code [@github repo](https://github.com/Av1-Lv5/personal-site-archive/tree/main/0)
