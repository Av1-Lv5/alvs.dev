_A detailed and exhaustive list of skills I have and tools I use_

### Programming languages

-   As I wanted to be a Frontend Web developer **Javascript** became mandatory to learn, **[Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)** is a boon for a javascript developer. So, had to learn both. I prefer to write in Typescript.
-   Tried **[Bash scripting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)** long back, have to get back at it.

### Frontend specific

-   Proficient with **[React js](https://react.dev)** a UI Framework, and **[Preact js](https://preactjs.com)** a lightweight 3kb alternative to React js providing similar api. Keeping an eye on new phase of UI frameworks [Solid JS](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [Svelte JS](https://svelte.dev/).
-   Currently my goto way of writing CSS is by using **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** a utility-first CSS framework.
-   My rendering frameworks of choice are **[Astro js](https://astro.build)** and **[Next js](https://nextjs.org)**. I switch between them most often, depends upon the project I am taking up and also sometimes the mood I am in.
-   Loved using **[Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com)** an unstyled a11y friendly React component library. When in necessary for a styled solution I prefer using **[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**, re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
-   Used to love using **[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com)** task runner but after getting used to **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev)**, it has become my default tool of choice everytime I start a new project.

### Backend services

-   I have tried CMS like wordpress once, Not into it but familiar with using it.
-   Loving the idea of Headless CMS, started off with **[sanity](https://sanity.io)** loved the experience.
-   Started using **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)** recently, as database setup was becoming a bottleneck for the ideas I get. Weighed between Firebase and Supabase, but its open source nature and the way Supabase is growing made me choose it. Used it for database alone so far, haven't touched all the other awesome features it offers, looking forward to explore it to its whole potential when I come across the right project.
-   **[Clerk](https://clerk.com/)** has become my goto auth solution, for its user management system and the generous free tier. Though Supabase has an auth solution built-in, I got comfortable with Clerk first so haven't tried Supabase auth yet.
-   Used **[Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)** bucket to store static files, its generous free tier is great and the developer experience is good. Loved it.
-   Have experience working with **[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)** for storing user profile pictures and media management. It's great for image transformations and optimization on the fly.

### Tools

-   My primary code editor is **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)**, loving it, everything feels faster. Tried **[Zed](https://zed.dev/)** and **[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)** as well but Cursor has something in the experience that's grown into my bones. Looking forward to use **[Kiro](https://kiro.ai/)**, currently on the waiting list.
-   **[Figma](https://figma.com/)** used to be my goto for wireframing and sometimes prototyping simpler UI components, but I am no designer, so feeling fond of simpler tools like **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)** for wireframing. I love to visually represent flow of things, be it components, be it how a feature works - for ideation I use Excalidraw, if I am feeling more in developer mood I go full **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)** syntax.
-   I use **[PNPM](https://pnpm.io)** as my default node package manager, for those who don't know it is disk efficient alternative to NPM.
-   Some CLI tools i often install on my machines are **[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)** for managing my nodejs installs on the system, **[homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** for managing softwares on my mac.
-   My version control system of choice is obviously **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**. I like to follow **[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)**, and I excel at creating great workflows for the needs of a team. Not just following standards like GitHub flow or Git flow, I create flavors of those based on the need for a team.
-   I have experience in working on all three major **Operating systems** Windows, Mac, and Linux. But i feel more efficient on Mac and Linux, Windows slows me down for some reason. If you are reading this please consider using linux its free, less resource intensive, no bloatware, developer friendly.
-   My linux distro hops if you're interested : **[ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)** (gnome DE) --> **[linux mint](https://linuxmint.com/)** (cinammon DE) --> **[garuda linux](https://garudalinux.org/)** (KDE Dr460nized DE) --> **[Fedora workstation](https://www.fedoraproject.org/)** (gnome DE)
