_A detailed and exhaustive list of skills I have and tools I use, told as a journey_

### It all started with the basics

-   As I wanted to be a Frontend Web developer, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **[Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** became mandatory to learn.
-   **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** felt like a boon for a Javascript developer, and now I prefer to write in Typescript.

### Some tooling sprinkled

-   To manage code and workflows, I picked up **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**. I like to follow **[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)**, and I excel at creating flavors of workflows like GitHub flow based on team needs.
-   My toolbelt expanded with **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** and **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** to ensure code quality, and **[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)** for advanced CSS processing.
-   I used to love the **[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)** task runner for automation.
-   For package management, I use **[PNPM](https://pnpm.io)** (disk efficient!) and often install **[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)** and **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** to manage my environment.

### From static pages to apps

-   I became proficient with **[React js](https://react.dev)** and **[Preact js](https://preactjs.com)** (a lightweight alternative).
-   While I used Gulp before, **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev)** has become my default build tool for every new project.
-   For styling, my goto is **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**, a utility-first framework that changed how I write CSS.

### Urge to showcase talent

-   Building apps is one thing, shipping them is another. I rely on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** and **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)** to get my projects live with ease.

### Exploring began when the apps I was building didn't feel production standard

-   I moved to meta-frameworks like **[Next js](https://nextjs.org)** (and **[Astro js](https://astro.build)**) depending on the project needs.
-   My UI demands grew, leading me to love **[Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com)** for accessibility, and eventually **[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** for beautiful, re-usable components.
-   State and data management became robust with **[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)**.
-   For forms, I integrated **[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)** paired with **[Zod](https://zod.dev/)** for schema validation.

### Baby Steps towards full stack apps through services integrations

-   I loved the Headless CMS experience with **[Sanity](https://sanity.io)**.
-   Database setup was a bottleneck until I found **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)**; chose it over Firebase for its open-source nature.
-   **[Clerk](https://clerk.com/)** became my goto for user management (generous free tier!).
-   For media, **[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)** handles my image transformations, while **[Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)** stores my static files.
-   I integrated **[Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/)** for payments and **[Typesense](https://typesense.org/)** when search needs arose.

### Charting the territories

-   I've built interactive map interfaces using **[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)** and **[Google Maps JS API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript)**.
-   This journey exposed me to the world of GIS, handling **KML**, **KMZ**, and **GeoJSON** data, and mastering the nuances of **vector** and **raster** tiles.

### Filling the gaps of a real product builder, the uncommons

-   **[Resend](https://resend.com/)** and **[React Email](https://react.email/)** modernized my transactional emails.
-   **[Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/)** helped me understand user behavior.
-   Use **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)** for API testing and **[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)** as my ORM of choice.
-   Added **[Motion](https://motion.dev/)** (formerly Framer Motion) for smooth animations.
-   I dabbled in **[Bash scripting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)** long back and am getting back to it to automate the uncommons.

### Going with flow, learning the hype

-   I'm constantly exploring. Currently looking at **[Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/)** for a code-first CMS and **[PostHog](https://posthog.com/)** for deeper product analytics.
-   Tooling is getting faster with **[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)** and **[Ultracite](https://ultracite.ai/)**.
-   **[Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/)** serves as a lightweight API client.
-   **[Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/)** is on my radar as a robust backend alternative.

### The Workshop

-   **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)** is my primary editor (loving the AI integration). I've tried **[Zed](https://zed.dev/)** and **[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)**, and I'm waiting for **[Kiro](https://kiro.ai/)**.
-   For design/wireframing, I use **[Figma](https://figma.com/)** and **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)** (or **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)** when in dev logic mode).
-   **Operating Systems**: I am efficient on Mac and Linux. My Linux distro journey: **[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)** -> **[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)** -> **[Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org/)** -> **[Fedora](https://www.fedoraproject.org/)**.
