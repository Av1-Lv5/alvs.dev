_A detailed and exhaustive list of skills I have and tools I use_

### Programming languages

-   As I wanted to be a Frontend Web developer **Javascript** became mandatory to learn, **[Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)** is a boon for a javascript developer. So, had to learn both. I prefer to write in Typescript.
-   Tried **[Bash scripting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)** long back, have to get back at it.

### Frontend specific

-   Proficient with **[React js](https://react.dev)** a UI Framework, and **[Preact js](https://preactjs.com)** a lightweight 3kb alternative to React js providing similar api. Keeping an eye on new phase of UI frameworks Solid JS and Svelte JS.
-   Currently my goto way of writing CSS is by using **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** a utility-first CSS framework.
-   My rendering frameworks of choice are **[Astro js](https://astro.build)** and **[Next js](https://nextjs.org)**. I switch between them most often, depends upon the project I am taking up and also sometimes the mood I am in.
-   Loved using **[Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com)** an unstyled a11y friendly React component library. When in necessary for a styled solution I prefer using **[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**, re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
-   Used to love using **[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com)** task runner but after getting used to **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev)**, it has become my default tool of choice everytime I start a new project.

### Backend services

-   I have tried CMS like wordpress once, Not into it but familiar with using it.
-   Loving the idea of Headless CMS, been using **[sanity](https://sanity.io)** recently.
-   Currently Learning **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/)** a payments infrastructure.

### Tools

-   My primary code editor is **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**
-   Goto Prototyping tool as of now is **[Figma](https://figma.com/)**
-   I use **[PNPM](https://pnpm.io)** as my default node package manager, for those who don't know it is disk efficient alternative to NPM.
-   Some CLI tools i often install on my machines are **[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)** for managing my nodejs installs on the system, **[homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** for managing softwares on my mac and linux systems.
-   My version control system of choice is obviously **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**. Haven't mastered the skill of maintaining a good commit history, but going to get there.
-   I have experience in working on all three major **Operating systems** Windows, Mac, and Linux. But i feel more efficient on Mac and Linux, Windows slows me down for some reason. If you are reading this please consider using linux its free, less resource intensive, no bloatware, developer friendly.
-   My linux distro hops if you're interested : **[ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)** (gnome DE) --> **[linux mint](https://linuxmint.com/)** (cinammon DE) --> **[garuda linux](https://garudalinux.org/)** (KDE Dr460nized DE) --> **[Fedora workstation](https://www.fedoraproject.org/)** (gnome DE)
