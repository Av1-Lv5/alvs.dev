I want to expand my understanding of software, its not like I want to get into those fields professionally but just the curiosity around understanding in depth of something I use and rely upon daily.

I am currently looking to be able to handle full stack development exploring `bun + hono`, yes inclined towards [BHVR stack](https://bhvr.dev/)

Beyond the browser, I want to build interfaces for:

- Desktop apps using **Tauri**
- Native mobile apps using React Native (not sure yet)
- Not going to leave TUI's, once I learn Go or Rust

I want to learn a different programming language as well

- It could be Go lang, mostly heard good things about it.
- I am even considering **Python + DJango** as it is battle tested, and the library ecosystem.
- Also most tools I personally love and use are built with **Rust**, and if ever I want to build something for web using WASM, Rust will be my goto.

_Yes, too much thinking for picking, so I just picked Go lang for now. Will see about others, when the time arrives_

### Tools

- They say(_yes, you primeagen_) a developer using vim, codes at the speed of thought, I heard **[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)** is a good starting point. At the very least, might pick up [Vim keybindings in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) to try out what the hype about those motions.
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org)** - 3D animation for the browser. Projects built with it are genuinely fun to interact with, something to explore when I want to build interactive creative websites
