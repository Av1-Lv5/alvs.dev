### As a developer

-   **[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)** programming language after watching [primeagen streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNFdkTIzdXM) on twitch. The excitement he shows for the language is incredible.
-   Learnt Headless CMS Sanity, but **[Strapi](https://strapi.io)** also seems interesting to me.
-   Looking forward to try **[neovim](https://neovim.io/)** a command line powerful text editor which helps in increasing productivity or atleast using [vim-bindings in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)
-   Projects built with 3d animation library **[Three.js](https://threejs.org)** are soo fun to interact with, might learn when i want to create my own fun interactive websites.
