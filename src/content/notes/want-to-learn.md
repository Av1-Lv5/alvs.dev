- Want to learn Python and **[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)** programming languages.
- Looking forward to try **[neovim](https://neovim.io/)** a command line powerful text editor which helps in increasing productivity or atleast using [vim-bindings in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)
- Projects built with 3d animation library **[Three.js](https://threejs.org)** are soo fun to interact with, might learn when i want to create my own fun interactive websites.
